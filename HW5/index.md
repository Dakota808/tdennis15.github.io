## Homework 5 Web Application MVC with local Database.

This project is to implement a MVC structure in an ASPNET web application through Visual Studio.
An explicit requirement is that all code and classes be well defined and strongly typed, and that as little code gets auto generated as possible.

The general workflow for this project was to create a new branch with every feature and then merge those branches once testing was completed.
