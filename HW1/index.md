## Homework 1
As the first homework assignment in CS 460 I created a web page using HTML5, Bootstrap and Github. This was to become familiar with these tools along with giving a template for future projects. As a webpage it is rather rough because templates or page writing utilities were not allowed. Each segment of code is created for the use of this site from scratch.
