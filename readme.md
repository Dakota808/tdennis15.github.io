New readme file for the second branch of my portfolio.
This branch is created to help the editing process of my second homework.
This second homework for CS460 involves making a jQuery function on a website.
I believe that rather than start over it might be a good idea to continue the work on my 
current page. That way if I wish to use the site as a resume builder it will include examples
of JS and Jquery.
